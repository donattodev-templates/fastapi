# Score Entity Class Documentation

## Overview

The `Score` class represents a student's score entity in the application, inheriting from `BaseEntity` and adding specific fields for student name and subject scores.

## Class Definition

```python
class Score(BaseEntity):
    name: str
    math_score: int
    english_score: int

    class Config:
        from_attributes = True
```

## Inheritance

`Score` inherits from `BaseEntity`, which provides a unique `id` field.

## Attributes

### name
- **Type**: str
- **Description**: The name of the student.

### math_score
- **Type**: int
- **Description**: The student's score in mathematics.

### english_score
- **Type**: int
- **Description**: The student's score in English.

## Configuration

The inner `Config` class sets `from_attributes = True`, which allows the model to be created from an ORM model.

## Dependencies

- `BaseEntity` from `pyservice.domain.entities.base_entity`

## Usage Example

```python
score = Score(name="John Doe", math_score=85, english_score=90)
print(score.id)  # Prints a UUID
print(score.name)  # Prints "John Doe"
print(score.math_score)  # Prints 85
print(score.english_score)  # Prints 90
```

## Features

1. **Automatic ID Generation**: Inherits the `id` field from `BaseEntity`, which is automatically generated.
2. **ORM Compatibility**: The `from_attributes = True` configuration allows easy integration with ORMs like SQLAlchemy.
3. **Type Validation**: Pydantic will ensure that the `name` is a string and both scores are integers.

## Notes

- The `Score` class doesn't implement any methods of its own, relying on the functionality provided by Pydantic and `BaseEntity`.
- The scores are represented as integers, which assumes a whole number scoring system.

## Potential Improvements

1. Add validation for score ranges (e.g., ensuring scores are between 0 and 100).
2. Include additional fields like `date_taken` or `grade_level` if relevant to the application.
3. Implement methods for calculating total score or average score.
4. Add docstrings to provide more detailed information about each field.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that when creating or updating `Score` instances, all required fields are provided.
- When using with an ORM, make sure the database schema matches the structure of this class.
- Consider implementing a factory method or helper functions if complex initialization logic is required.
