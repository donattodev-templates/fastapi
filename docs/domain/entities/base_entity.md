# BaseEntity Class Documentation

## Overview

The `BaseEntity` class serves as a base model for entities in the application, providing a common structure with an auto-generated UUID.

## Class Definition

```python
class BaseEntity(BaseModel):
    id: UUID = Field(default_factory=uuid4)
```

## Inheritance

`BaseEntity` inherits from Pydantic's `BaseModel`.

## Attributes

### id

- **Type**: UUID
- **Description**: A unique identifier for the entity.
- **Default**: Auto-generated using `uuid4()` function.

## Dependencies

- `BaseModel` from `pydantic`
- `Field` from `pydantic`
- `UUID` from `uuid`
- `uuid4` from `uuid`

## Usage

To use `BaseEntity`, simply inherit from it when defining new entity classes:

```python
class MyEntity(BaseEntity):
    name: str
    value: int
```

## Features

1. **Automatic ID Generation**: Each instance of a class inheriting from `BaseEntity` will automatically get a unique UUID.
2. **Pydantic Integration**: Inherits all features of Pydantic's `BaseModel`, including data validation and serialization.

## Notes

- The use of `Field(default_factory=uuid4)` ensures that a new UUID is generated for each instance, rather than sharing a single UUID across all instances.
- This base class can be extended to include common fields or methods that should be present in all entities.

## Potential Improvements

1. Add created_at and updated_at timestamps.
2. Implement custom methods for common operations on entities.
3. Add additional base fields that might be common across all entities in your system.

## Best Practices

- Use this base class consistently across all entities in your application to ensure a uniform structure.
- When adding new entities, consider if any new common fields should be added to `BaseEntity` instead of individual entity classes.
