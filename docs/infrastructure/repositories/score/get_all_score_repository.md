# get_all_score_repository Function Documentation

## Overview

The `get_all_score_repository` function is responsible for retrieving all score records from the database. It queries the `ScoreModel` and returns all instances.

## Function Signature

```python
def get_all_score_repository(db: Session):
```

## Parameters

- `db` (Session): The SQLAlchemy database session object

## Return Value

- On success: A list of `ScoreModel` instances representing all scores in the database
- On failure: The function will raise an exception

## Functionality

1. Uses the provided database session to query all `ScoreModel` instances
2. Returns the list of all score records

## Error Handling

- If any exception occurs during the process:
  - The exception is logged
  - The exception is re-raised (implicitly)

## Dependencies

- `logging`: For exception logging
- `sqlalchemy.orm`: For the Session type
- `pyservice.infrastructure.models.score_model`: For the `ScoreModel` class

## Usage Example

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from pyservice.infrastructure.adapters.postgres_adapter import get_db

db = next(get_db())

try:
    all_scores = get_all_score_repository(db)
    for score in all_scores:
        print(f"ID: {score.id}, Name: {score.name}, Math: {score.math_score}, English: {score.english_score}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to retrieve scores: {str(e)}")
```

## Notes

- This function retrieves all records without any filtering or pagination. For large datasets, consider implementing pagination or filtering mechanisms.
- There's a TODO comment about logging errors to OpenTelemetry, which should be implemented for better observability.

## Potential Improvements

1. Implement the TODO for logging errors to OpenTelemetry.
2. Add pagination support to handle large datasets efficiently.
3. Include optional parameters for filtering (e.g., by score range, name, etc.).
4. Consider returning a custom DTO (Data Transfer Object) instead of the ORM model directly, to decouple the database model from the API response.

## Best Practices

- Always use this function within a try-except block to handle potential exceptions.
- Be cautious when using this function with large datasets, as it may lead to performance issues. Consider implementing pagination or limiting the number of records returned.
- Ensure that the database session is properly managed (opened and closed) by the caller.
- If the function is used in an API endpoint, consider implementing caching mechanisms to improve performance for frequently accessed data.
