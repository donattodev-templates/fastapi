# Database Connection Configuration Documentation

## Overview

This module configures and manages the database connection for the application using SQLAlchemy. It sets up the database URL based on the environment, creates the database engine, and provides a session factory.

## Configuration

### Environment Detection

```python
environment = getenv('ENVIRONMENT', 'development')
```

- Uses the `ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to determine the current environment.
- Defaults to 'development' if not set.

### Database URL Configuration

```python
if environment == 'production':
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = config['application']['infrastructure']['databases']['postgres']['connection_strings']['production']
else:
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = config['application']['infrastructure']['databases']['postgres']['connection_strings']['development']
```

- Sets the database URL based on the environment.
- Uses different connection strings for production and development environments.

## SQLAlchemy Setup

### Engine Creation

```python
engine = create_engine(SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL)
```

- Creates a SQLAlchemy engine using the configured database URL.

### Session Factory

```python
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
```

- Creates a session factory for database operations.
- `autocommit=False`: Transactions must be committed explicitly.
- `autoflush=False`: Changes won't be automatically flushed to the database.

### Declarative Base

```python
Base = declarative_base()
```

- Creates a base class for declarative models.

## Database Session Management

```python
def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()
```

- A generator function to manage database sessions.
- Yields a database session and ensures it's closed after use.

## Dependencies

- `os`: For environment variable access.
- `sqlalchemy`: For database operations and ORM functionality.
- `pyservice.config`: For accessing application configuration.

## Usage

### Accessing the Database in FastAPI

```python
from fastapi import Depends
from .database import get_db

@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # Use the db session here
    pass
```

## Notes

- The database URL is configured differently for production and development environments.
- The `get_db` function is designed to be used with FastAPI's dependency injection system.

## TODO

- Implement an interface for the adapter and test with MySQL.

## Potential Improvements

1. Implement connection pooling for better performance in high-concurrency scenarios.
2. Add error handling and retries for database connection failures.
3. Implement a more robust configuration system, possibly using environment-specific config files.
4. Add logging for database operations and connection events.

## Best Practices

- Always use the `get_db` function to obtain a database session, ensuring proper resource management.
- Keep sensitive information like connection strings in environment variables or secure configuration files.
- Regularly update and patch the database and ORM libraries to address security vulnerabilities.
