# ScoreModel ORM Documentation

## Overview

The `ScoreModel` class is an SQLAlchemy ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) model that represents the 'score' table in the database. It defines the structure and properties of a score record.

## Class Definition

```python
class ScoreModel(Base):
    __tablename__ = "score"

    id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, nullable=False)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    math_score = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    english_score = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
```

## Inheritance

`ScoreModel` inherits from `Base`, which is typically the declarative base class provided by SQLAlchemy.

## Table Name

The model is associated with the "score" table in the database through the `__tablename__` attribute.

## Attributes

### id
- **Type**: UUID
- **Constraints**: Primary Key, Not Nullable
- **Description**: A unique identifier for each score record.

### name
- **Type**: String
- **Constraints**: Not Nullable
- **Description**: The name of the student associated with the score.

### math_score
- **Type**: Integer
- **Constraints**: Not Nullable
- **Description**: The student's score in mathematics.

### english_score
- **Type**: Integer
- **Constraints**: Not Nullable
- **Description**: The student's score in English.

## Dependencies

- `pyservice.infrastructure.adapters.postgres_adapter`: For the `Base` class.
- `sqlalchemy`: For ORM functionalities (`Column`, `Integer`, `String`).
- `sqlalchemy`: For the `UUID` data type.

## Usage Example

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from uuid import uuid4

# Assuming you have a database session
def create_score(db: Session, name: str, math_score: int, english_score: int):
    new_score = ScoreModel(
        id=uuid4(),
        name=name,
        math_score=math_score,
        english_score=english_score
    )
    db.add(new_score)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(new_score)
    return new_score
```

## Notes

- This model directly corresponds to the 'score' table structure defined in the database schema.
- The use of UUID for the 'id' field ensures a universally unique identifier for each record.
- All fields are set as non-nullable, enforcing data integrity at the ORM level.

## Potential Improvements

1. Add data validation (e.g., score ranges) using SQLAlchemy's `CheckConstraint` or by overriding `__init__`.
2. Implement additional methods for common operations (e.g., `calculate_average()`).
3. Add relationships if this model is related to other tables/models.
4. Include timestamp fields (e.g., `created_at`, `updated_at`) for better record tracking.

## Best Practices

- Keep this model in sync with the actual database schema.
- Use this model for all database operations related to the 'score' table to ensure consistency.
- Consider adding docstrings to the class and its attributes for better code documentation.
- If complex queries are needed, consider adding class methods or using a separate query object.
