# Score Table Creation Documentation

## Overview

This module defines the structure of the 'score' table and provides a function to create it in the database if it doesn't already exist.

## Function: create_score_table

```python
def create_score_table():
    """Creates the 'score' table if it doesn't exist."""
    # Function implementation...
```

### Purpose
This function is responsible for creating the 'score' table in the database if it doesn't already exist.

### Functionality
1. Creates a `MetaData` object to hold the table definition.
2. Defines the 'score' table structure using SQLAlchemy's `Table` constructor.
3. Uses the `create_all` method to create the table in the database if it doesn't exist.

## Table Structure: 'score'

The 'score' table is defined with the following columns:

| Column Name    | Data Type                | Constraints                |
|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| id             | UUID                     | Primary Key, Not Null      |
| name           | String                   | Not Null                   |
| math_score     | Integer                  | Not Null                   |
| english_score  | Integer                  | Not Null                   |

### Column Details

- **id**: A UUID field serving as the primary key for the table.
- **name**: A string field to store the student's name.
- **math_score**: An integer field to store the student's math score.
- **english_score**: An integer field to store the student's English score.

## Dependencies

- `sqlalchemy`: For defining table structure and creating it in the database.
- `pyservice.infrastructure.adapters.postgres_adapter`: For accessing the database engine.
- `sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql`: For using PostgreSQL-specific UUID type.

## Usage

To create the 'score' table in the database:

```python
from pyservice.infrastructure.mapping.score_table import create_score_table

create_score_table()
```

This function is typically called during application startup to ensure the required table exists.

## Notes

- The function uses the `engine` imported from `postgres_adapter`, ensuring it uses the correct database connection.
- The table creation is idempotent â€“ it won't throw an error if the table already exists.
- The use of UUID for the 'id' field provides a universally unique identifier for each record.

## Potential Improvements

1. Add index definitions if certain columns are frequently used in queries.
2. Implement versioning or migration system for table schema changes.
3. Add constraints for score ranges (e.g., scores between 0 and 100).
4. Include additional fields like 'created_at' or 'updated_at' for record tracking.

## Best Practices

- Call this function during application startup to ensure the table exists.
- Keep the table definition in sync with the corresponding SQLAlchemy model.
- Consider using database migrations for managing schema changes in production environments.
- Ensure that the database user has the necessary permissions to create tables.
